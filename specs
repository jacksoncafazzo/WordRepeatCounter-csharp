Logic Specs
first test if the method compiles.
  I think this should be a boolean for simplicity.
user will input two strings:
  one will be the word they are searching for,
    I choose this to be a string because we only wanted whole word matches.
  the other will be the string they want to search through.
    This I cast into a string array word by word with Regex so it's easy to iterate.
test for returning a true bool from a match from the string.
  start with a bool for simplicity.
test for adding the match to a counter and returning it.
  use an int and add one too it, nothing simpler.
make the RepeatCounter object with a counter in it.
  it will also hold the user inputs.
    test for the object to return proper values.
  return the object.

Interface Specs
Index invites user to enter a word and a string to search in two text boxes and click submit.

Create object with inputs and run CountRepeats on it
Show the object on a new page.
Show the word and sentence as placeholders in text fields, inviting user to change either and submit new search.
return to new search page showing previous searches.

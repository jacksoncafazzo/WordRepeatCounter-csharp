Logic Specs
first test if the method compiles.
test for user will input two strings:
  one will be the word they are searching for,
    I choose this to be a string because we only wanted whole word matches.
  the other will be the string they want to search through.
    This I cast into a string array word by word with Regex so it's easy to iterate.
test for returning a true bool from a match from the string.
  start with a bool for simplicity.
test for adding the match to a counter and returning it.
  use an int and add one too it, nothing simpler.
test for RepeatCounter to count repeats.

Interface Specs
Index invites user to enter a word and a string to search in two text boxes and click submit.
Test if the user entered anything, if either string is empty, display an alert and return to index

Create object with inputs and run RepeatCounter on it
Show the object on a new page.
Show the word and sentence as placeholders in text fields, inviting user to change either and submit new search.
return to new search page showing previous searches.
invite user to add another search or clear all instances
return user to home or cleared page.
